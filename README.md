My solution to **homework 1-5** for** CS 201 Data Structures and Algorithm** course using **C++**

- **Homework 1,3,4,5:**
C++ program that finds the kth largest number among a set of N numbers using; insertion sort, sort K, heap sort using binary heap and quick select algorithms and combination of all to compare the efficiency of each algorithm.
	1. Insertion Sort and Sort K [Homework-1]
	1. Heap Sort [Homework-3]
	1. Quick-select [Homework-4]
	1. Compare all and evaluate result [Homework-5]


- **Homework 2:**
C++ program that evaluates an infix arithmetic expression , then outputs this expression in postfix form along with the result of the calculation. The program will first convert the input infix expression to a postfix expression (using the Stack ADT) and then calculate the result using stack.
